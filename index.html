                <p>
                    The town of Ashford felt like it belonged to another world. Fog clung to its streets like the ghost of something ancient and forgotten, swirling around the narrow alleys and casting everything in a hazy, dreamlike light. Claire stared out of the bus window as it rattled into the town, her fingers pressed against the cold glass, eyes tracing the contours of a place that seemed barely awake. She had wanted to disappear, and Ashford looked like the kind of town that would allow her to do just that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She shifted in her seat as the bus groaned to a stop, her muscles stiff from the hours of travel. The town stretched out before her in a melancholy silence, its main street flanked by shops that looked as though they hadnâ€™t changed in decades. There were few people on the street, and those who were moved with a kind of lethargic disinterest, their faces half-hidden behind scarves and upturned collars.
